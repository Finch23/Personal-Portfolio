    <p>My name is Nicholas Finch, I am from Mebane, North Carolina. I had originally gotten my Associate's degree in IT from a local Community College. After very little success in the job hunt, I decided to further my education with the coding bootcamp. I am currently a server at Red Robin and have been for 2 years. Although I think writing code is a good challenge my dream job would be in music production. I love playing the piano and I am very interested in learning more instruments.
